VulnScanner is a web application vulnerability scanner based on the OWASP Top 10, designed to detect common security issues such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting, Broken Authentication, and Security Misconfigurations. Implemented as a Google Colab notebook, it allows users to easily run scans on safe/demo targets and generate visual outputs and reports. The project includes example results and screenshots to demonstrate its functionality, making it suitable for learning and educational purposes.
